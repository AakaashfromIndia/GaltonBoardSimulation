# Galton Board Simulation
![Galton Board - Made with Clipchamp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c8e701-cc8f-4a76-940c-fbc1c9d9a096)
A comprehensive interactive simulation of the Galton Board (also known as the Bean Machine or Quincunx) built with Python, demonstrating probability distributions and the Central Limit Theorem through visual animation.

## Overview

The Galton Board is a classic probability demonstration device invented by Sir Francis Galton. This simulation recreates the physical apparatus digitally, allowing balls to fall through a triangular array of pegs and collect in bins at the bottom. The resulting distribution approximates a normal (bell curve) distribution, providing an excellent visualization of fundamental statistical concepts.
